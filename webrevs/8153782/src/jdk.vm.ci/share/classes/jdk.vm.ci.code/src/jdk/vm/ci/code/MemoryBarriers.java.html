   Note to customizers: the body of the webrev is IDed as SUNWwebrev
   to allow easy overriding by users of webrev via the userContent.css
   mechanism available in some browsers.

   For example, to have all "removed" information be red instead of
   brown, set a rule in your userContent.css file like:

       body#SUNWwebrev span.removed { color: red ! important; }

  26  * Constants and intrinsic definition for memory barriers.
  27  *
  28  * The documentation for each constant is taken from Doug Lea's
  29  * &lt;a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/jmm/cookbook.html"&gt;The JSR-133 Cookbook for Compiler
  30  * Writers&lt;/a&gt;.
  31  * &lt;p&gt;
  32  * The {@code JMM_*} constants capture the memory barriers necessary to implement the Java Memory
  33  * Model with respect to volatile field accesses. Their values are explained by this comment from
  34  * templateTable_i486.cpp in the HotSpot source code:
  35  *
  36  * &lt;pre&gt;
  37  * Volatile variables demand their effects be made known to all CPU's in
  38  * order.  Store buffers on most chips allow reads &amp;amp; writes to reorder; the
  39  * JMM's ReadAfterWrite.java test fails in -Xint mode without some kind of
  40  * memory barrier (i.e., it's not sufficient that the interpreter does not
  41  * reorder volatile references, the hardware also must not reorder them).
  42  *
  43  * According to the new Java Memory Model (JMM):
  44  * (1) All volatiles are serialized wrt to each other.
  45  * ALSO reads &amp;amp; writes act as acquire &amp;amp; release, so:
  46  * (2) A read cannot let unrelated NON-volatile memory refs that happen after
  47  * the read float up to before the read.  It's OK for non-volatile memory refs
  48  * that happen before the volatile read to float down below it.
  49  * (3) Similarly, a volatile write cannot let unrelated NON-volatile memory refs
  50  * that happen BEFORE the write float down to after the write.  It's OK for
  51  * non-volatile memory refs that happen after the volatile write to float up
  52  * before it.
  53  *
  54  * We only put in barriers around volatile refs (they are expensive), not
  55  * _between_ memory refs (which would require us to track the flavor of the
  56  * previous memory refs).  Requirements (2) and (3) require some barriers
  57  * before volatile stores and after volatile loads.  These nearly cover
  58  * requirement (1) but miss the volatile-store-volatile-load case.  This final
  59  * case is placed after volatile-stores although it could just as well go
  60  * before volatile-loads.
  61  * &lt;/pre&gt;
